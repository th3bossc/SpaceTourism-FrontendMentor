## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [AngularJS](https://angular.io/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS preprocessor


### What I learned

I learnt how to use Angular's signals and router more profusely than I had ever implemented in my past projects. Working on this also helped me get a hang of Sass and angular's workflow


### Useful resources

- [Angular Documentation](https://www.angular.io/docs) - Simple and accurate documentation from Angular community was very helpful when trying to figure out how to do many of the things i was trying for the first time.
